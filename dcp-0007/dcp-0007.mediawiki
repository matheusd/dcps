==Abstract==

This proposes reverting the currently active maximum expenditure policy of the
treasury account to the one specified in the original Politeia proposal for the
decentralized treasury.

==Motivation==

The current algorithm that calculates the maximum expenditure allowed by a set
of treasury spend transactions within a given window of blocks takes into
account the average spent in a preceding window.

This is different then the policy that was originally proposed and approved by
stakeholders in the original Politeia proposal for development of the
decentralized treasury<ref>[[https://proposals-archive.decred.org/proposals/c96290a]]</ref>
and has caused an issue that has prevented payments from the treasury account
from being performed.

This proposal modifies the consensus rules to ensure the maximum expenditure
policy is in line with what was explicitly approved via Politeia voting, by
using the total income into the treasury as the reference value to determine the
spending limit.

The maximum expenditure amount is currently calculated by the <code>dcrd</code> reference
node implementation by the
<code>maxTreasuryExpenditure()</code><ref>[[https://github.com/decred/dcrd/blob/afff2fdbcd4c57ade4f0d13e78ad2d3efaebcdec/blockchain/treasury.go#L650]]</ref>
function. This function defines the following policy:

<blockquote>The sum of treasury spend amounts inside the most recent expenditure window
cannot exceed the average of the spent amount in the preceding N windows in
addition to a 50% increase. If no amount is spent in the preceding windows,
the maximum allowed amount equals a bootstrap amount in addition to a 50%
increase.</blockquote>

For mainnet, the expenditure policy window has a size of 6912 blocks and 6
preceding windows are checked, for a total of 41472 blocks. A bootstrap amount
of 16K DCR is used.

A deeper overview of the issue can be read on the Treasury Expenditure Policy Bug
blog post<ref>[[https://blog.decred.org/2021/06/25/Treasury-Expenditure-Policy-Bug/|]]</ref>.

==Specification==

Change the maximum expenditure policy to the following:

<blockquote>The sum of treasury spend amounts inside the most recent expenditure window
cannot exceed the total amount received by the treasury in the same window, in
addition to a 50% increase.</blockquote>

==Rationale==

Changing the expenditure policy to the one originally specified and approved by
stakeholders in Politeia should not be controversial from a community discussion
standpoint and solves the immediate issues facing the blocking of spending funds by
the decentralized treasury.

The two policies are largely compatible at this point in time since the following
relevant factors are valid under both policies:

* The current average expenditure amount being withdrawn from the treasury.
* The existing <code>mainnet</code> test treasury spend transaction.

Therefore, if no treasury spend transactions are mined such that they are
incompatible to the new rule until the new rule is activated and sufficiently
confirmed, it will be possible to remove legacy code dealing with the old
policy.

==Deployment==

This agenda will be deployed to mainnet using the standard Decred on-chain
voting infrastructure as follows:

{|
!Name!!Setting
|-
|Deployment Version||9
|-
|Agenda ID||treasuryexppolicy
|-
|Agenda Description||Modify the treasury maximum expenditure policy as defined
in DCP0007
|-
|Start Time||XXXXX
|-
|Expire Time||XXXXX
|-
|Mask||0x06 (Bits 1 and 2)
|-
|Choices||{| !Choice!!English Description!!Bits
|-
|abstain||abstain voting for change||0x00
|-
|no||keep the existing consensus rules||0x02 (Bit 1)
|-
|yes||change to the new consensus rules||0x04 (Bit 2)
|}
|}

==Compatibility==

This is a hard-forking change to the Decred consensus.  This means that once the
agenda is voted in and becomes locked in, anybody running code that fully
validates blocks must upgrade before the activation time or they will risk
rejecting a chain containing a transaction that is invalid under the old rules.

Other software that performs full validation will need to modify their consensus
enforcement rules accordingly.

The changes introduced by this proposal modify block acceptance criteria, but no
transaction semantics are affected, therefore software other than full nodes or
ones dealing directly with accounting of treasury transactions will not be
affected by these changes.

==Reference Implementation==

<pre>
policyWindow := b.chainParams.TreasuryVoteInterval *
    b.chainParams.TreasuryVoteIntervalMultiplier *
    b.chainParams.TreasuryExpenditureWindow

// First: sum up treasury spends, treasury adds and treasurybases inside the 
// most recent policyWindow.
spentRecent, addedRecent, _, err := b.sumPastTreasuryExpenditure(preTVINode, policyWindow)
if err != nil {
    return 0, err
}

// Treasury can spend up to 150% the amount received in the window.
addedPlusAllowance := addedRecent + addedRecent/2

// The maximum expenditure allowed for the next block is the difference
// between the maximum possible and what has already been spent in the most
// recent policy window. This is capped at zero on the lower end to account
// for cases where the policy _already_ spent more than the allowed.
var allowedToSpend int64
if addedPlusAllowance > spentRecent {
    allowedToSpend = addedPlusAllowance - spentRecent
}

return allowedToSpend, nil
</pre>
